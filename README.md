# Image Slider

Making an image slider for [practice](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions#image-slider)

## Deploying:

Do all this in the main branch...

- Run `npm run build` to create the production build in dist/
- Create a commit for that release and push that to GitHub
- Run `npm run deploy` to run the git script that pushes only the dist/ folder
to the gh-pages branch, which automatically deploys to the gh-pages site.
